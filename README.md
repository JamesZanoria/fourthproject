Grocery Shopping Cart

Overview
This project is a simple shopping cart system built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Product data is fetched dynamically from the provided API and displayed as product cards. Users can add products to their cart, update quantities by adding the same product again, and remove products entirely.
API Used:
https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/apis/fetching-data/can-store/products.json

Features
- Fetch and display products dynamically from the API.
- Each product card includes an image, name, price, and "Add to Cart" button.
- Add products to the shopping cart.
- If the same product is added again, the quantity increases instead of duplicating entries.
- Remove an item completely from the cart with the "Remove" button.
- Cart updates dynamically in real-time.

- Add to Cart: Clicking "Add to Cart" adds the item to the cart.
